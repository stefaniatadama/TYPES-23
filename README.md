# Containers Revisited, in Cubical Agda

Two proofs of the central result that the container extension functor, mapping containers to endofunctors in $\underline{\mathbf{Set}}$, is full and faithful. One follows the proof given in [Containers: Constructing strictly positive types](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397505003373), and the other is a new proof that makes use of the Yoneda lemma. We have proved this result for the case of generalised containers, which are parameterised by an arbitrary category $\underline{\mathbf{C}}$ and give rise to functors of type $\underline{\mathbf{C}} \to \underline{\mathbf{Set}}$.
